The LaCrosse 2300 series has a nasty bug where it seems to read 114mph when it 
(too frequently) loses wireless synch with the outside sensors.  This causes
many errors in historical hi/low, noaa reports, etc.

To find these records:

echo "SELECT * FROM archive WHERE (windSpeed > 112);" | sqlite3 mydb.sdb
echo "SELECT * FROM archive WHERE (windGust  > 112);" | sqlite3 mydb.sdb

To null out these fields:

echo "UPDATE archive SET windSpeed=0 WHERE (windSpeed > 112);" | sqlite3 mydb.sdb
echo "UPDATE archive SET windGust=0  WHERE (windGust  > 112);" | sqlite3 mydb.sdb


==> as always, work off a temporary copy of your db just in case
