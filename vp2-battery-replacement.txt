Noticed a console message on the VP2 saying the battery was low.  The example graph here shows that weewx 'did' detect it and graph it.

Fixed the issue by:
  - entered setup on the console (hold Done and down-arrow down)
  - replaced the CR123 on the ISS
  - hold done for a few seconds to exit setup
  - waited for the console to reestablish comms with the ISS in a couple minutes
